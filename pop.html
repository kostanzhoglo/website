    <p> I used to really dislike Gregg Popovich.  He always beat the Phoenix Suns come playoff time.  But he deserves all the respect in the world.  He's a real American, a patriot, smart as a whip, and pushes people around him to greatness.  He's also earned everything he's gotten.</p>

    <p> It seems like my computer needs a little reminder... </p>

    <h2>Quote by Popovich</h2>
      <p>The measure of who we are is how we react to something that doesn't go our way.</p>

    <h3>More quotes by the same guy</h3>
      <p>No one is bigger than the team. If you can't do things our way, you're not getting time here and we don't care who you are.</p>
      <p>It's never been my goal to be king of the prom. It's been my goal to do the right thing and get the job done.</p>
      <p>I asked them if it wasn't too much trouble, if I wasn't being too pushy, if they could execute what we were trying to do. And if it didn't make them too angry, if they also wanted to play some defense on the other end, that would be great.</p>
