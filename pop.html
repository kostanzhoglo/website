    <p> I used to really dislike Gregg Popovich.  He always beat the Phoenix Suns come playoff time.  But he deserves all the respect in the world.  He's a real American, a patriot, smart as a whip, and pushes people around him to greatness.  He's also earned everything he's gotten.</p>

    <p> It seems like my computer needs a little reminder... </p>

    <h2>Quote by Popovich</h2>
    <p>The measure of who we are is how we react to something that doesn't go our way.</p>

    <h3>More quotes by the same guy</h3>
    <p>No one is bigger than the team. If you can't do things our way, you're not getting time here and we don't care who you are.</p>
