#This is practice 5.

I should send Adam Pritchard a thank you note for that helpful doc about Markdown.
Hey Adam, here's a link to [Hallmark Thank You notes](https://www.hallmark.com/thank-you/).

Much appreciated!

I wonder what places I should donate money to.
[NPR](http://www.npr.org/)?
[World Wildlife Fund](https://www.worldwildlife.org/)?
