# Practice 6.  How does Markdown become HTML?

Here's another [page](http://kirkstrobeck.github.io/whatismarkdown.com/) that should help explain how Markdown works, and some best practices.

Side note: a weird thing about this web page is that the http:// doesn't show up in the web address bar, but I copied and pasted it into the link above, and sure enough, there was the *http://*.  Weird!
